        <p class="sec-1-text">You want to pick a console, but can't because you don't know which one is "better"
            or "the best". What if I told you there is no such thing? In this confusing social
            media world where facts and opinons on such matters are blowing strong left and right,
            its easy to get caught in the storm and never end up picking. or even worse: You pick
            a switch, watch a few videos on why the PS5 is better, and instantly start to question your 
            decision(not to mention the video has over a million views to add insult to injury).
            No need to do that, and by the end of this article you'll know exactly what console
            is right for you and your needs. I want you to see that the grass is green on all sides
            of the console fences, so there is no bad choice, you just need to pick the right lawn.
            It all starts with you and what it is that you want.
            No one knows you better than you know you. we are going to quickly address the pros and
            cons of both consoles to clear up all the confusion, so lets get into it.</p>
        <h1 class="sec-title">THE GAMES</h1>

        <p class="sec-1-text">Now and days video game consoles are more than just video game consoles. They are super
            computers that can probably be programmed to drive you to the store if need be. but they
            are still video game consoles at thier core so the games are
            undebatably the most important aspect. The PS5 library having currently only 509 games,
            versus the Switch's towering 5,000 plus! Thats almost more than ten times the amount!
            Theres clearly more to chose from on switch and that is a BIG plus, but let's not count
            out Sony's 5th star child just yet.</p>

        <h1 class="sec-title">SINGLE PLAYER & MULTIPLYER GAMES</h1>
        <div class="flex-d-img">

        <p class="sec-1-text">Nintendo since its start in the 1980's have always been about family fun and the switch
            is no exception to that. With great single player and multiplayer games
            for everyone that are also exclusive to the switch such as "Hades 2" and "Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon". 
            The ps5 has great exclusive games that have also won awards such as god of war and Elden Ring.
            As far as multiplyer if your into realistic sports games the ps5 packs a punch there to.
            It also has great shooting games, such as call of duty and battlefield that are online multiplyers.
            Just you vs the world.
            Nintendo's multiplyer games are more so ment to be enjoyed, not online, but in a room with
            friends and family(trust me, we have a blast everytime!). They have online of course, but
            unless your playing super smash bro ultimate, its not the main focus of the console as always stated
            by nintendo. Its casual family fun for everyone, with 8 controllers
            as well for certain party games(Mario party, Nintendo switch sports, Mario kart),
            while nintendo is not celebrated for realistic sport games or realistic
            games at all for that matter(Super mario oddessy, Donkey Kong Country).This brings us to our next point:
            graphics.
            </p>

        <h1 class="sec-title">GRAPHICS AND POWER</h1>
        <p class="sec-1-text">The Ps5 dominates this area. "I have both, I prefer my switch. But the PS5 has great    power and oppurtunity 
            for new games. The only reason I prefer my switch is that I love portable gaming, 
            and the PS5 does not have too many games 
            yet (only 481) compared to the switch which has 4366 games."
            says AlexTheNerd. Lets talk about what the Ps5 can do.
             IT has double the frame for some games(120fps versus switch's 60fps),
            which makes it look more beatiful and run smoother, With it having more realistic 
            games(spiderman, demon souls, deadspace, uncharted) 
            it needs the graphical power to support them.
            The output resolution of the ps5 is 8k while the
            switch is at 1080p. The output resolution is the amount of pixles a image can have, the
            higher the resolution,the more the pixels, the better the image quality. 
            Most switch games have a cartoony
            art-style to them and don't focus on realism(Mario, Zelda, pokemon), so it doesn't really need a high
            output resolution. The Ps5 also has a faster processor than the switch. The switch
            uses a Nvidia tegra chip, which is designed to power modern smartphones and mobile
            devices. the Tegra chip is not even on equal playing grounds to the Ps4 and Xbox one(previous console generation)
            as far as power, as opposed to a 
            home body like a Ps5 which uses a 36 CU(compute processor) that
            runs up to 2.23GHz(really really fast!). In plain english, the switch's processor
            has to sacriface power due to it being mobile(thats right, you can take it on the go.) and having to conserve
            power, as opposed to when it's docked(being played on a t.v) it has more power(
            similar to when you plug a laptop into a wall), but
            thats not saying much. </p>
        <h1 class="sec-title">TO SUM IT UP</h1>
        <p class="sec-1-text">
            So all in all, if you like casual, fun gaming and like the more cartoony
style then switch is for you.It will run you $299 as of 2023, If you like the more realistic and online multiplyer
games then the Ps5 is for you, and will run you $499. I hope I cleared the smoke for you.
below I have some linked sources for you if you want to learn more.
The choice is yours, and neither one is a bad one, although I would recommend the switch, the
Ps5 is no slouch.
