        <h1 class="sec-title">KNOW THYSELF</h1>
        <p class="sec-1-text">You want to pick a console, but can't because you don't know which one is "better" or "the best". What if I told you there is no such thing? In this confusing social media world where facts and opinions on such matters are blowing strong left and right it's easy to get caught in the storm and never end up picking. or even worse: You pick a switch, watch a few videos on why the PS5 is better, and instantly start to question your decision(not to mention the video has over a million views to add insult to injury). No need to do that, and by the end of this article you'll know exactly what console is right for you and your needs. I want you to see that the grass is green on all sides of the console fences, so there is no bad choice, you just need to pick the right lawn. It all starts with you and what it is that you want. No one knows you better than you know you. Below, we are going to quickly address the pros and cons of both consoles to clear up all the confusion, so let's get into it.

        <h1 class="sec-title">THE GAMES</h1>

        <p class="sec-1-text">Now and days video game consoles are more than just video game consoles. They are supercomputers that can probably be programmed to drive you to the store if need be. but they are still video game consoles at their core so the games are undoubtedly the most important aspect. The PS5 library having currently only 509 games, versus the Switch's towering 5,000 plus! That's almost more than ten times the amount! There's more to choose from on Switch and that is a BIG plus, but let's not count out Sony's 5th star child just yet.</p>

        <p class="sec-1-text">Nintendo, since its start in the 1980s has always been about family fun and the Switch is no exception to that. With great single-player and multiplayer games for everyone that are also exclusive to the switch such as "Hades 2" and "Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon". The PS5 has great exclusive games that have also won awards such as "The God Of War" and "Elden Ring". As far as multiplayer if you are into realistic sports games the PS5 packs a punch there too. It also has great shooting games, such as "Call of Duty" and "Battlefield" which are online multiplayer: Just you versus the world. Nintendo's multiplayer games are to be enjoyed, not online, but in a room with friends and family(trust me, we have a blast every time!). They have online of course, but unless you playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate, it's not the main focus of the console as always stated by Nintendo. It is casual family fun for everyone, with eight controllers as well for certain party games(Mario Party, Nintendo Switch sports, Mario Kart). Nintendo is not celebrated for realistic sports games or realistic games at all for that matter("Super Mario Odyssey" and "Donkey Kong Country"). This brings us to our next point: graphics.

        <h1 class="sec-title">GRAPHICS AND POWER</h1>
        <p class="sec-1-text">The Ps5 dominates this area. "I have both, and I prefer my Switch, But the PS5 has great power and opportunity for new games. The only reason I prefer my Switch is that I love portable gaming, and the PS5 does not have too many games yet (only 481) compared to the Switch which has 4366 games." says AlexTheNerd. Let's talk about what the PS5 can do. It has double the frame for some games(120fps versus Switch's 60fps), which makes it look more beautiful and run smoother, With it having more realistic games("Spiderman", "Demon Souls", "Deadspace", and "Uncharted") it needs the graphical power to support them. The output resolution of the PS5 is 8k while the switch is at 1080p. For those who don't know, The output resolution is the number of pixels an image can have, the higher the resolution, the more the pixels, thus the better the image quality. Most Switch games have a cartoony art style to them and don't focus on realism(Mario, Zelda, Pokemon), so it doesn't need a high output resolution. The PS5 also has a faster processor than the Switch. The switch uses a Nvidia Tegra chip, which is designed to power modern smartphones and mobile devices. the Tegra chip is not even on equal playing grounds to the PS4 and Xbox One (previous console generation) as far as power, as opposed to a homebody like a PS5 which uses a 36 CU(compute processor) that runs up to 2.23GHz(really really fast!). In plain English, the Switch's processor has to sacrifice power due to it being mobile(that's right, you can take it on the go.) and having to conserve power, as opposed to when it's docked(being played on a TV) it has more power (similar to when you plug a laptop into a wall), but that's not saying much.</p>
        <h1 class="sec-title">TO SUM IT UP</h1>
        <p class="sec-1-text">
            So all in all, if you like casual, fun gaming and like the more cartoony style then Switch is for you. It will run you $299 as of 2023, If you like the more realistic and online multiplayer games then the PS5 is for you and will run you $499. I hope I cleared the smoke for you. below I have some linked sources for you if you want to learn more. The choice is yours, and neither one is bad, although I would recommend the switch, the PS5 is no slouch.
